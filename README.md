# Call Me Over!

A web application that allows students to call teachers over if they have questions. Designed for TJHSST Summer Computer Science 2016.

## How To Use

Run the following to install required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a .env file containing the username and password of the administrator page as well as the port to run the program.

Allow students to submit requests from the index.html page, and manage these requests from the admin.html page.  Allows admin to change the currently displayed message (accepts HTML tags) as well as respond to messages, or manage the queue of students by either removing the top student or clearing the list.
